## Iteration 8 - 2026-01-10
**Story**: [US-1.1] Set up Linode server with nginx
**Status**: ✅ Complete

### What was implemented
- Verified SSH access to 69.164.201.191 works
- Installed nginx on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
- Created /var/www/ralphmode.com directory
- Configured nginx site at /etc/nginx/sites-available/ralphmode.com
- Enabled site and removed default config
- Installed certbot and python3-certbot-nginx
- Created placeholder index.html on server
- Verified http://69.164.201.191 returns 200

### Server Details
- OS: Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (Linux 6.8.0-71-generic)
- nginx: 1.24.0
- Web root: /var/www/ralphmode.com
- nginx config: /etc/nginx/sites-available/ralphmode.com

### SSL Status
- certbot installed and ready
- SSL certificate pending DNS configuration (US-1.2)
- Once DNS points to server, run: `certbot --nginx -d ralphmode.com -d www.ralphmode.com`

### Learnings
- Infrastructure stories blocked until .env password was correct
- SSL certificate requires domain to resolve to server IP first
- nginx config listens on both domain and IP for flexibility
