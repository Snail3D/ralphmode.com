# ralphmode.com - Project Context

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Public Repo - Use .env for Secrets!

This repo is **PUBLIC** on GitHub. Never commit passwords or secrets directly to code.

### What is .env?
A `.env` file stores secrets locally on your machine. It's listed in `.gitignore` so it never gets pushed to GitHub.

```bash
# Create .env file (this stays LOCAL, never pushed)
echo "LINODE_PASSWORD=your_actual_password" > .env

# Create .env.example (this IS pushed, shows what's needed)
echo "LINODE_PASSWORD=your_password_here" > .env.example
```

### Secrets for this project:
- **Linode Password**: Store in `.env`, use `LINODE_PASSWORD`
- **Server IP**: 69.164.201.191 (this is fine to commit, IPs are public)

### .gitignore must include:
```
.env
```

## What This Is

A landing page + download package for the **Ralph Pattern** - an autonomous AI coding loop that lets Claude Code implement features while you sleep.

**Domain**: ralphmode.com (purchased on GoDaddy)
**GitHub**: https://github.com/Snail3D/ralphmode.com
**Server**: Linode at 69.164.201.191 (label: ralphmode.com)

## The Vision

Create the #1 resource for people wanting to use the Ralph pattern with Claude Code. One-click download of a ready-to-go Ralph starter kit.

### What Ralph Is

Ralph (named after Ralph Wiggum) is a bash loop that:
1. Reads a `prd.json` with user stories
2. Spawns Claude Code with `--dangerously-skip-permissions`
3. Claude picks a story, implements it, commits, marks it done
4. Loop repeats until all stories pass
5. You wake up to shipped features

## Infrastructure

### Linode Server
- **IP**: 69.164.201.191
- **Label**: ralphmode.com
- **Password**: See `.env` file (LINODE_PASSWORD)
- **SSH**: `ssh root@69.164.201.191`

### GoDaddy DNS Setup (MANUAL STEP REQUIRED)

**Current Status**: Domain is parked at Afternic (GoDaddy's parking service). Needs manual configuration.

#### Step 1: Change Nameservers (if using Afternic)
1. Log into GoDaddy: https://dcc.godaddy.com
2. Go to Domain Settings → DNS → Nameservers
3. Change from Afternic to GoDaddy nameservers:
   - `ns1.domaincontrol.com`
   - `ns2.domaincontrol.com`

#### Step 2: Configure A Records
1. Go to DNS Management
2. Delete any existing A records for @ and www
3. Add new A records:

| Type | Name | Value | TTL |
|------|------|-------|-----|
| A | @ | 69.164.201.191 | 600 |
| A | www | 69.164.201.191 | 600 |

#### Step 3: Wait for Propagation
- DNS changes can take 15 minutes to 48 hours
- Check progress: `dig ralphmode.com A`
- Expected result: `69.164.201.191`

#### Step 4: Get SSL Certificate
Once DNS is pointing to the server:
```bash
ssh root@69.164.201.191
certbot --nginx -d ralphmode.com -d www.ralphmode.com
```

### Tech Stack (Suggested)
- Simple static site (HTML/CSS/JS) or Astro/Next.js
- Hosted on Linode with nginx
- Or use GitHub Pages / Vercel for simplicity
