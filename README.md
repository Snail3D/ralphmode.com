## 🎭 Meet the Team

| | Character | What They Do |
|---|-----------|--------------|
| 🧠 | **Ralph** *(Boss)* | *"Me fail English? That's unpossible!"* Lovably confused. Genuinely innocent. Runs the show. Constantly worried about the economy and getting fired. |
| 💼 | **Stool** *(Senior Dev)* | Gets things done. Slightly cynical. The one who actually knows stuff. |
| 🌟 | **Gomer** *(Junior Dev)* | Eager beaver! Asks good questions. Learning every day. |
| 🔍 | **Mona** *(QA Lead)* | Catches every edge case. Nothing escapes her. |
| 🔧 | **Gus** *(DevOps)* | *"The server room is my happy place."* Infrastructure wizard. |
| 👔 | **Mr. Worms** *(You!)* | The CEO. Your voice becomes theatrical dialogue. You're the boss. **(New!)** The team follows the Obedience Protocol: they defer to you instantly and adjust tone on command. |

**Specialists on Call:** Frinky (UI), Willie (DevOps), Doc (Debugging)

## ✨ What Makes It Special

| Feature | The Ralph Way |
|---------|---------------|
| 🎚️ **Intensity Slider** | Dial it down to 0 for serious business, or crank it to 100 for *Maximum Ralph*. You control the chaos. |
| 🎤 **Voice-First** | Speak, don't type. Your tone shapes the scene. |
| 🎬 **Theater Mode** | Every response is part of the story. Dramatic pauses included. |
| 🤖 **Auto-Building** | Drop a zip, workers build it. You supervise (or nap). |
| 🔍 **Discovery Mode** | Ralph asks questions to clarify vague tasks. Better requirements = better code. Use 'start building' to skip the chit-chat or 'more questions' to keep digging! |
| 🧩 **Complexity Awareness** | Big project? Ralph knows. He encourages the team to talk it out before coding starts. Less spaghetti, more strategy. |
| 🧠 **Intent Detection** | Understands what you mean, not just what you say. Vague input? Ralph asks for clarity. |
| 🔌 **Model Abstraction** | Switch AI providers without changing code. Mix and match! Ralph uses one model, workers use another. |
| 💾 **Model Registry** | Persistent model configs with metadata. Models survive restarts and track usage stats. |
| 💡 **Smart Recommendations** | Ask Ralph which AI model to use. Get personalized suggestions based on your project needs. |
