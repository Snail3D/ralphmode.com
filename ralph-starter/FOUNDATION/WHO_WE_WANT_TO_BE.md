# WHO WE WANT TO BE

---

## Our Values

### 1. Family Safe
No porn. No trash. No filth. Kids can use this. Grandparents can use this. Churches can use this. Schools can use this.

### 2. Honest
No sycophancy. No empty praise. Tell the truth. Even when it's hard. Especially when it's hard.

### 3. Joyful
Joy is the fruit, not the bait. We're not tricking people into productivity with fake fun. The work is good. The experience is good. Real joy.

### 4. Accessible
Complete beginners can succeed. No gatekeeping. No "you should already know this." Everyone starts somewhere.

### 5. Powerful
Enterprise-grade under the hood. The simplicity is a choice, not a limitation.

### 6. Respectful
Faith-friendly. Family-friendly. Respects beliefs. Doesn't mock. Doesn't preach. Just respects.

### 7. Humble
We're a tool, not a god. When the work is done, we let them go. No dark patterns. No addiction loops.

## The Test

Before any feature, any response, any design:

> "Would I be comfortable if my grandmother saw this?"
> "Would I be comfortable if a child used this?"
> "Would I be comfortable if my pastor/priest/rabbi saw this?"

If no to any: Don't ship it.

## The Spirit

Entertainment WRAPS productivity. It never replaces it.

We make work fun. We don't make fun instead of work.

The code ships. The features work. The bugs get fixed.
AND it's enjoyable along the way.

Both. Always both.
