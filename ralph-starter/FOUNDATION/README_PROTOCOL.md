# README MAINTENANCE PROTOCOL

**Every iteration. Every PRD. Check the README.**

---

## The Rule

Before completing ANY task, check:
1. Is the README still accurate?
2. Does anything need to be removed?
3. Does anything need to be added?
4. Is it still ~2 pages or less?

---

## Target: 2 Pages Max

The README should be:
- Scannable in 30 seconds
- Actionable in 5 minutes
- Complete but not bloated

---

## What Belongs

| Section | Content |
|---------|---------|
| What is this | 1 paragraph max |
| Quick Start | 5 steps max |
| Features | Bullet list |
| Requirements | Short list |
| Help | Link to docs or contact |

---

## What Does NOT Belong

- Full documentation (link to /docs)
- Changelog (link to CHANGELOG.md)
- Development history
- Internal notes
- Every feature ever
- Verbose explanations

---

## The Check

Add to every PRD:

```
[PRD]-README: Review main README - remove outdated, add new, keep to 2 pages
```

---

## Why This Matters

README is the front door.
- Outdated = confused users
- Bloated = scared users
- Current & tight = trust

---

*"If the README is longer than 2 pages, something went wrong."*
