STEP 2: FOUNDATIONAL CHECK
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
🚨 RED FLAGS DETECTED:
  - Change mentions 'edge case' - suggests weakening a principle

Questions to answer before proceeding:
  1. Does this change align with our core identity?
  2. Would the original creators recognize us after this change?
  3. Are we improving the rule or abandoning a principle?

Considerations:
  • The Ten Rules define who Ralph Mode is at its core
  • Changes should strengthen principles, not weaken them
  • If unsure, default to KEEPING THE RULE

STEP 3: IMPACT ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Risk Level: HIGH
Requires Code Changes: Yes

Affected Systems:
  • content_filter.py
  • sanitizer.py
  • personality_manager.py

What Breaks:
  ⚠️  Family-safe content filtering may need adjustment

What We Lose:
  💔 Clear moral boundary that guides all responses

STEP 4: DELIBERATION GUIDELINES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is NOT a quick decision.

Process:
  1. Read this report carefully
  2. Sleep on it (minimum 24 hours)
  3. Discuss with team if applicable
  4. If still unsure: KEEP THE RULE

Remember:
  • These rules define WHO WE ARE
  • Without them, we're just another AI wrapper
  • Crack the foundation, the building falls
