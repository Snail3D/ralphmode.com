# WHERE WE ARE GOING

---

## The Mission

Build the best AI-powered builder that is safe for ALL ages, ALL people, and ALL things.

---

## The Goal

A self-building, perpetual system that:
- Gets better every day
- Serves millions of users
- Runs without constant supervision
- Makes money while we sleep
- Could sell for $1,000,000+

---

## The Product

Ralph Mode is the EXPERIENCE layer on top of AI.

Users bring their own AI (Claude, GPT, Llama, etc.).
We bring the personality, the theater, the magic.

We are Uber for AI coding.
We don't own the cars. The drivers bring cars.
We don't own the AI. Users bring their API keys.

---

## The Scale

We are building for Facebook-level scale.

Not because we're arrogant.
Because our business model allows it.

Per-user cost: Nearly zero.
Ralph works for popsicles.
Users pay their own AI bills.
