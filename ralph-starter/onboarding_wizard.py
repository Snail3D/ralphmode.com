• A super secret handshake 🤝
• A magic password that never gets typed 🎩
• Your special badge that says "This is ME!" 👤

The cool part? You make TWO keys:
• **Private key** - stays on YOUR computer FOREVER (never share!)
• **Public key** - you give this to GitHub (it's safe!)

→ Try adding the key to GitHub again

**Error: "Could not resolve hostname github.com"**

**Error: "Host key verification failed"**
→ Type `yes` when it asks "Are you sure you want to continue?"

**Error: "No such file or directory"**
→ Your SSH key might not exist

Why? Because GitHub uses the email to link your commits to your account! If you use a different email, your commits won't show up on your profile!

*Where to find your GitHub email:*
Go to: https://github.com/settings/emails
Look for your PRIMARY email!

*Type your email:*

Ralph SO PROUD! You configured Git!

Now every time you save your code, Git writes YOUR name on it!

*What this means:*
✅ Your commits show YOUR name
✅ GitHub knows it's you
✅ Your profile shows your contributions
✅ You're officially a Git user now!

*Fun fact:*
This is saved FOREVER in commit history! In 10 years, people can see who wrote the code! That's pretty cool!

*What's a commit?*
A "commit" is like taking a snapshot of your code! Git saves it with:
• The code changes you made
• YOUR name (that we just set up!)
• The date and time
• A message about what you changed

It's like a diary entry for your code! 📔

*Next up:*
Ralph can help you make your first commit! Or we keep setting up other stuff!

**Common Problems:**

**Problem 1: "git command not found"**
→ You need to install Git first!
→ Mac: Download from https://git-scm.com/download/mac
→ Windows: Download from https://git-scm.com/download/windows
→ Linux: `sudo apt install git` (Ubuntu) or `sudo yum install git` (Fedora)

**Problem 2: "Nothing shows when I check"**
→ Commands might have failed silently
→ Try running them again one at a time
→ Make sure you using the right Terminal/Command Prompt

**Problem 3: "Shows different name/email"**
→ You already configured Git before!
→ Just run the commands again with the NEW info
→ It will overwrite the old settings!

**Problem 4: "I don't know if it worked"**
→ Run: `git config user.name` to see your name
→ Run: `git config user.email` to see your email
→ If they show up, it worked!

**Problem 5: "I made a typo in my name/email!"**
→ No problem! Just run the commands again with the CORRECT info!
→ Git will update it!

*Why --global?*
The `--global` flag means this works for ALL your projects!
Without it, you'd have to set it up for EACH project separately!
Ralph recommend always use --global for your personal computer!

*Still stuck?*
Tell Ralph exactly what error message you seeing!
Or what shows when you run `git config --list`

Okay! Ralph make this SUPER simple!

*Imagine you writing a story...*

**WITHOUT version control:**
• You write: "The cat sat on the mat"
• Next day you change it to: "The dog sat on the mat"
• But now you forget what it was before!
• If you mess up, you can't go back!
• You have to save "story_v1.txt", "story_v2.txt", "story_FINAL.txt", "story_FINAL_REAL.txt"... CHAOS!

**WITH version control (Git):**
• You write: "The cat sat on the mat" → Save it! (commit)
• Next day: "The dog sat on the mat" → Save it! (commit)
• Git remembers BOTH versions!
• You can see what changed!
• You can go back to "cat" if you want!
• Only one file! Git handles all the versions!

*For code, it's even better:*
• You try adding a feature → Commit
• Feature breaks everything → No problem! Go back!
• You wanna see what you changed last week → Git shows you!
• Working with friends → Git merges everyone's code!

Think of Git like:
• 💾 A save system in a video game (but for code!)
• 📸 A photo album of your code over time
• ⏰ A time machine you can use to go back
• 📖 A history book that never forgets

*Why developers LOVE Git:*
✅ Never lose code
✅ Try new things without fear
✅ Work with other people without chaos
✅ See who changed what and when
✅ Go back if something breaks

Ralph uses Git EVERY DAY! All the professionals do!

*Cool right?* Now you know why we set up your name! 🎉

You using the fancy way! Ralph impressed!

**First, you need the `gh` tool!**

Check if you got it:

gh --version

If you see a version number, you got it! If not, install it:
• Mac: `brew install gh`
• Linux: Check your package manager
• Windows: Download from https://cli.github.com

**Then, create your repo!**

*For a PUBLIC repo:* (everyone can see)
```bash
gh repo create {project_name} --public --clone
```

*For a PRIVATE repo:* (only you can see)
```bash
gh repo create {project_name} --private --clone
```

*What this does:*
• `gh repo create` - Makes a new repo
• `{project_name}` - The name
• `--public` or `--private` - Who can see it
• `--clone` - Downloads it to your computer too!

Ralph recommend public for learning!

**PRIVATE Repository** 🔒
• Only YOU can see it (unless you invite someone)
• Good for: Secret projects, work stuff, personal code
• Also free! (GitHub lets you have private repos now!)
• Nobody can see your code without permission
• Doesn't show on your public profile

*Ralph's Advice:*
If you learning to code → Use PUBLIC!
Other people can help you and see your progress!

If it's got passwords or secrets → Use PRIVATE!
Keep the secret stuff secret!

You can always change it later in settings!
