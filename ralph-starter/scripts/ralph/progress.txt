# Ralph Progress Log

Started: 2026-01-10
Project: Ralph Mode Bot

---

## Codebase Patterns
<!-- Add reusable patterns here as you discover them -->

- WORK_QUALITY_PRIORITY constant for consistent quality messaging across all AI calls
- task_type parameter in call_worker() for context-specific quality guidance
- check_work_quality() helper for programmatic quality verification

---

## Iteration 1 - 2026-01-10
**Task**: [RM-034] Work Quality First - Entertainment Second
**Status**: ✅ Complete

### What was implemented
- Added WORK_QUALITY_PRIORITY constant with core quality principles
- Updated call_worker() to include quality priority in all worker system prompts
- Added task_type parameter ("general", "code", "analysis", "review") for context-specific guidance
- Created check_work_quality() helper method for programmatic quality verification
- Updated _generate_prd() to be more specific and actionable
- Updated generate_ralph_report() to emphasize actionable recommendations

### Files changed
- ralph_bot.py

### Learnings
- The golden rule "if choice between funny and correct, ALWAYS choose correct" is now embedded in every worker call
- Task-specific guidance helps workers give better output for code, analysis, and review tasks
- Quality checking can be done programmatically to catch vague responses

---

## Iteration 2 - 2026-01-10
**Task**: [RM-035] Smart Workers Despite the Drama
**Status**: ✅ Complete

### What was implemented
- Enhanced DEV_TEAM personalities with explicit COMPETENCE sections
- Each worker now has documented technical expertise that can't be compromised
- Added specialty field to each worker (frontend, backend, architecture, debugging)
- Created pick_worker_for_task() to match workers to tasks by specialty
- Created get_worker_specialty_intro() for quick specialty descriptions
- Created explain_simply() method for workers to explain complex concepts simply

### Files changed
- ralph_bot.py

### Learnings
- Personality is the WRAPPER, competence is the CORE
- Workers' quirks (chill, confused-seeming, annoying, grumpy) don't affect their expertise
- Matching workers to tasks by specialty produces better results
- Good workers can explain complex things simply because they truly understand them

## Iteration 3 - 2026-01-10
**Task**: [RM-036] Real Actionable Output
**Status**: ✅ Complete

### What was implemented
- Added quality_metrics tracking dict to __init__
- Created complete quality metrics tracking system:
  - init_quality_metrics() - initialize tracking for a session
  - track_task_identified() - track when tasks are found
  - track_task_completed() - track when tasks are done
  - track_code_provided() - track when code snippets are given
  - track_issue_found() - track issues identified with severity
  - track_quality_check() - track quality check pass/fail
  - get_quality_summary() - get formatted metrics summary
- Created generate_actionable_output() for structured task output
- Updated deliver_ralph_report() to include quality metrics
- Added "View Quality Metrics" button in report
- Added view_metrics callback handler

### Files changed
- ralph_bot.py

### Learnings
- Quality metrics help demonstrate value to the CEO
- Structured output (SUMMARY, CODE, NEXT STEPS, FILES) makes tasks actionable
- Tracking task completion rates shows productivity

## Iteration 4 - 2026-01-10
**Task**: [RM-001] Ralph Dyslexia Misspellings
**Status**: ✅ Complete

### What was implemented
- Created ralph_misspell(text, misspell_chance=0.2) method
- Applies misspellings randomly (~20% of applicable words)
- Preserves capitalization and punctuation
- Uses existing RALPH_MISSPELLINGS dict
- Updated call_boss() to apply misspellings to all Ralph output
- Added apply_misspellings parameter for control

### Files changed
- ralph_bot.py

### Learnings
- 20% misspell rate feels natural - not every word, but enough to notice
- Preserving punctuation and capitalization is important for readability
- ralph_misspell() can be reused for any Ralph text output

---

## Iteration 5 - 2026-01-10
**Task**: [RM-002] Color-Coded Character Messages
**Status**: ✅ Complete

### What was implemented
- Created get_character_prefix(name) helper method
- Created format_character_message(name, title, message) for consistent formatting
- Uses CHARACTER_COLORS dict (already defined)
- Updated worker_bribes_ralph() to use color formatting
- Updated _start_ralph_session() - Ralph entrance, team greetings, responses
- Updated handle_text() - Ralph: commands
- Updated deliver_ralph_report() - team reactions
- Format: '{emoji} *Name:* _Title_: message'

### Files changed
- ralph_bot.py

### Learnings
- Color emoji prefixes make it instantly clear who's speaking
- format_character_message() centralizes formatting for consistency
- Can be easily extended with more colors for specialists

---

## Iteration 6 - 2026-01-10
**Task**: [RM-007] Typing Indicators
**Status**: ✅ Complete

### What was implemented
- Created send_typing(context, chat_id, duration) for typing indicators
- Created send_with_typing() that auto-calculates duration based on message length:
  - Short (<50 chars): 0.5-1s
  - Medium (50-150): 1-2s
  - Long (>150): 2-3s
- Updated worker_bribes_ralph() to use typing
- Updated _start_ralph_session() - team greetings, Ralph/worker responses
- Updated handle_text() - Ralph: command responses
- Typing shown while AI generates responses too

### Files changed
- ralph_bot.py

### Learnings
- Variable typing duration feels more natural than fixed delay
- Typing before AI calls masks the API latency
- Reduces fixed asyncio.sleep() delays - typing does double duty
