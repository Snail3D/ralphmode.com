## Codebase Patterns
<!-- Add reusable patterns here as you discover them -->

- WORK_QUALITY_PRIORITY constant for consistent quality messaging across all AI calls
- task_type parameter in call_worker() for context-specific quality guidance
- check_work_quality() helper for programmatic quality verification

## Iteration 1 - 2026-01-10
**Task**: [RM-034] Work Quality First - Entertainment Second
**Status**: ✅ Complete

### What was implemented
- Added WORK_QUALITY_PRIORITY constant with core quality principles
- Updated call_worker() to include quality priority in all worker system prompts
- Added task_type parameter ("general", "code", "analysis", "review") for context-specific guidance
- Created check_work_quality() helper method for programmatic quality verification
- Updated _generate_prd() to be more specific and actionable
- Updated generate_ralph_report() to emphasize actionable recommendations

### Files changed
- ralph_bot.py

### Learnings
- The golden rule "if choice between funny and correct, ALWAYS choose correct" is now embedded in every worker call
- Task-specific guidance helps workers give better output for code, analysis, and review tasks
- Quality checking can be done programmatically to catch vague responses
