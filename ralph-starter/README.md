## 🎭 Meet the Team

| | Character | What They Do |
|---|-----------|--------------|
| 🧠 | **Ralph** *(Boss)* | *"Me fail English? That's unpossible!"* Lovably confused. Genuinely innocent. Runs the show. |
| 💼 | **Stool** *(Senior Dev)* | Gets things done. Slightly cynical. The one who actually knows stuff. |
| 🌟 | **Gomer** *(Junior Dev)* | Eager beaver! Asks good questions. Learning every day. |
| 🔍 | **Mona** *(QA Lead)* | Catches every edge case. Nothing escapes her. |
| 🔧 | **Gus** *(DevOps)* | *"The server room is my happy place."* Infrastructure wizard. |
| 👔 | **Mr. Worms** *(You!)* | The CEO. Your voice becomes theatrical dialogue. You're the boss. |

## ✨ What Makes It Special

| Feature | The Ralph Way |
|---------|---------------|
| 🎤 **Voice-First** | Speak, don't type. Your tone shapes the scene. |
| 🎬 **Theater Mode** | Every response is part of the story. Dramatic pauses included. |
| 🤖 **Auto-Building** | Drop a zip, workers build it. You supervise (or nap). |
| 🔍 **Discovery Mode** | Ralph asks questions to clarify vague tasks. Better requirements = better code. |
| 🧠 **Intent Detection** | Understands what you mean, not just what you say. Vague input? Ralph asks for clarity. |
| 🔌 **Model Abstraction** | Switch AI providers without changing code. Mix and match! Ralph uses one model, workers use another. |
| 🔒 **Broadcast-Safe** | Secrets filtered. Swears become *\*jaw clenches\**. Stream it live! |
| 👥 **Multi-User** | Owner, Power Users, Viewers - everyone has a role. |
| 🛡️ **Enterprise Security** | OWASP Top 10 covered. We take this seriously. |

## 🧠 AI Providers

> *"I pick the good ones!"* - Ralph

**NEW:** Model Abstraction Layer lets you mix and match AI providers! Ralph uses Groq, workers use Anthropic, Frinky uses GLM - all at once! 🎭

| Provider | Status | Why |
|----------|--------|-----|
| 🏠 **Local AI (Ollama)** | ✅ **Preferred** | Free. Private. Your data stays home. |
| ⚡ **Groq** | ✅ Allowed | Fast! Free tier! Not Grok! *(Now pluggable!)* |
| 🤖 **Anthropic** | ✅ Allowed | Claude is our friend. *(Builder role ready!)* |
| 🎨 **GLM (Z.AI)** | ✅ **Design Agent** | Frinky's brain! All aesthetic decisions. |
| ❌ Grok (xAI) | **BANNED** | *"That's a bad word!"* |
| ❌ OpenAI | **BANNED** | *"Stranger danger!"* |
